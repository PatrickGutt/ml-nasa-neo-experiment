# Experimenting with NASA's Nearest-Earth-Objects (NEOs) Data Set

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects/data

The dataset, available on Kaggle, provides information on nearest-Earth objects (NEOs) discovered from January 1, 2001, to June 14, 2022, sourced directly from the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) and hosted by NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Experiments resulted in an improvement in the accuracy score of our models ($97$% ) from the baseline model found on Kaggle ($91$%).
